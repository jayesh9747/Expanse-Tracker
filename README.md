## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the ExpenseTracker Django application.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd expensetracker
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

First, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed. Then, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and fill it with the following template:

```env
# === Database ===
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# ----- Google Auth ------
CLIENT_ID= 
SECRET= 

# === Application ===
SECRET_KEY=
DEBUG=

#==== Email ====
EMAIL_HOST_USER=
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=

# ==== Cloud ===== 
cloud_name=
APIKEY=
APISECRET=
```

Fill in the values for each variable according to your configuration.

### 5. Run Migrations

Apply database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Start the Application

Run the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your Django application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

- The frontend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Additional Information

- Ensure that your database is set up and accessible with the credentials provided in the `.env` file.
- The `SECRET_KEY` should be a unique, unpredictable value.
- Set `DEBUG=True` for development and `DEBUG=False` for production.
